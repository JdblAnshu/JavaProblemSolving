/*
What is thread starvation?
Thread starvation is basically a situation or condition where a thread wonâ€™t be able to have regular access to shared resources and therefore is unable to proceed or make progress. This is because other threads have high priority and occupy the resources for too long. This usually happens with low-priority threads that do not get CPU for its execution to carry on.
